# Music Sorter
musicSorter.rb is a music sorting script I made :D

## How to use it?
Will sort your music nicely into folders, using the metadata found within the song files. Just run the script in the directory where all your unsorted songs reside, and give the script the location where you would like your sorted songs to end up in as the argument


e.g:
`ruby musicSorter.rb /home/tradam/myMusic/`

## Dependencies
Requires the ffruby gem to be installed, which in turn requires libavformat and libavcodec libraries to be installed on your system
