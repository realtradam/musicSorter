# Music Sorter
musicSorter.rb is a music sorting script I made :D Feel free to use this code as you will, I would appreciate being credited if you do.

Will sort your music nicely into folders, using the metadata found within the song files

Requires the ffruby gem to be installed, which in turn requires libavformat and libavcodec libraries to be installed on your system
